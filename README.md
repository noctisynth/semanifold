# Semifold

Next-generation cross-language monorepo version and release management tool.

Nowadays, cross-language monorepos are becoming more and more common. For example, a monorepo may contain a Rust library and a Node.js package, developers use `napi-rs` to create Rust bindings for Node.js.

`semifold` (CLI: `smif` | `semifold`) helps teams manage versions, changelogs, and package publishing across large cross-language monorepos with **consistency, automation, and zero pain**. Whether you are building libraries, apps, or services across multiple languages, Semifold keeps your release pipeline clean and predictable.

## ðŸ§  Inspiration

Semifold was inspired by the great work from the following projects:

[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) â€” a simple and elegant changeset-based versioning workflow, mainly focused on JavaScript and npm monorepos.

[Covector](https://github.com/jbolda/covector/) â€” a flexible multi-target release manager designed to support more complex ecosystems.
