    Build and validate the public package without Node.js or DOM ambient types, share JSON contract fixtures with the Rust protocol tests, and prepare OIDC-only automated npm publishing after the initial version is published locally.

- [`5b6694b`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/5b6694bbd17d86f9f3b44977ea402849d26228a3): Format generated plugin SDK bindings with Biome before writing or drift checks, and enforce SDK formatting in CI.

### New Features

- [`5496c96`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/5496c96f4a5b26626ac7267b64b81c96fafc0b6b): Adapt authenticated JavaScript plugins directly to the existing ecosystem boundary, with deterministic snapshot conversion and host-side validation of project roots, package identities, paths, edit sources, duplicate targets, and streamed file hashes.

    default, private packages keep them disabled by default, and either default can now be overridden
    explicitly without changing registry publishability.

## v0.4.0-rc.0

### Bug Fixes

- [`6838d72`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/6838d72730fc38e389885322637621bba0d2aadd): Introduce explicit domain and application error boundaries and remove `anyhow` from the engine.

    All production targets now reject panic-prone unwraps, expects, indexing, and slicing under strict
    Clippy validation, including workspace planning, Rust manifest edits, changelog metadata parsing,
    configuration editing, and embedded initialization assets.


### Refactors

- [`d50a156`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/d50a156035a6520442c0bbd44923d5ac2b36f6b1): Move project loading, configuration synchronization, release planning, changelog preparation, and
    release application behind `SemifoldService` and the new `semifold-engine` boundary.

    CLI and CI now share an immutable `ReleasePlan` followed by a complete `ReleaseApplyPlan`, MCP no
    longer changes the process working directory, and the legacy global mutable `Context` is removed.

## v0.4.0-beta.3

    Shared version sources now merge bumps across every inheriting crate, validate channel policy, keep
    private crates in the version closure, and update the owning workspace manifest exactly once.


### Refactors

- [`ea86a6a`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/ea86a6a87bb6b155d13e1aceabe9cf7f3da974fd): Use kebab-case for every Semifold configuration field.

    Snake-case configuration keys are no longer supported. Repository configuration, generated
    configuration, and fixtures now use fields such as `dry-run`, `extra-env`, and `extra-headers`.
