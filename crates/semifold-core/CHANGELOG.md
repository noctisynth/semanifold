# Changelog

## v0.1.0-rc.2

### Bug Fixes

- [`9b3eb89`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/9b3eb89ebd4460c2bcfed5fd73daafe3ff27b069): Use `nodejs` as the canonical built-in ecosystem identity so domain serialization, existing package configuration, adapter lookup, and future plugin registration share one stable value without aliases.

### New Features

- [`5496c96`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/5496c96f4a5b26626ac7267b64b81c96fafc0b6b): Adapt authenticated JavaScript plugins directly to the existing ecosystem boundary, with deterministic snapshot conversion and host-side validation of project roots, package identities, paths, edit sources, duplicate targets, and streamed file hashes.
- [`dd10f1a`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/dd10f1a00b2a99219861083ba3fc10d07322fe72): Introduce validated, stable ecosystem identities and a schema-versioned plugin protocol for metadata, discovery, inspection, edit planning, and structured diagnostics.
- [`8caff0a`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/8caff0ad5ace8ca72600ed1acabd08a6a1ec2b13): Migrate domain packages, plans, contexts, and adapters to open ecosystem identities while preserving built-in serialization and ordering compatibility ahead of dynamic plugin registration.

## v0.1.0-rc.1

### New Features

- [`2f843f3`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/2f843f38b196bf61cffd41daa6ae07cdccd6fe94): Allow workspace owners to customize complete changelog release blocks and individual changeset entries with strict MiniJinja templates. Template contexts now expose structured summaries and commit metadata, while stable release markers let publish consume arbitrary rendered formats without breaking legacy changelogs.

## v0.1.0-rc.0

### New Features

- [`6838d72`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/6838d72730fc38e389885322637621bba0d2aadd): Introduce explicit domain and application error boundaries and remove `anyhow` from the engine.

    All production targets now reject panic-prone unwraps, expects, indexing, and slicing under strict
    Clippy validation, including workspace planning, Rust manifest edits, changelog metadata parsing,
    configuration editing, and embedded initialization assets.


### Refactors

- [`d50a156`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/d50a156035a6520442c0bbd44923d5ac2b36f6b1): Move project loading, configuration synchronization, release planning, changelog preparation, and
    release application behind `SemifoldService` and the new `semifold-engine` boundary.

    CLI and CI now share an immutable `ReleasePlan` followed by a complete `ReleaseApplyPlan`, MCP no
    longer changes the process working directory, and the legacy global mutable `Context` is removed.

## v0.1.0-beta.2

### New Features

- [`ea86a6a`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/ea86a6a87bb6b155d13e1aceabe9cf7f3da974fd): Support Rust packages that inherit `workspace.package.version`.

    Shared version sources now merge bumps across every inheriting crate, validate channel policy, keep
    private crates in the version closure, and update the owning workspace manifest exactly once.

- [`2624d2d`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/2624d2d12fb9678d3f622a2aac69acddbd3af5f4): Model changelog rendering as immutable package and changeset facts.

    Changelog collection now resolves package sections and optional commit and pull request metadata
    before passing a capability-free aggregate context to the Markdown formatter.

- [`2624d2d`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/2624d2d12fb9678d3f622a2aac69acddbd3af5f4): Add deterministic workspace release contexts and strict release branch templates.

    Release branch templates now consume a workspace release view derived from the same validated plan
    that versioning applies.

## v0.1.0-beta.1

### New Features

- [`e8f8a09`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/e8f8a0966142aacdab13a33d41332fd9612e4cf9): Add one-shot channel transition bump overrides to `config channel set`, including a preserve mode for entering prerelease channels without raising the stable version base.

## v0.1.0-beta.0

### Bug Fixes

- [`fd19bf0`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/fd19bf09d523d07f75813c064b97b8ca899d2d64): Preserve configured package IDs when manifests share names across ecosystems.

### New Features

- [`e108ed0`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/e108ed0721d928d8ca543ce7bc3c00db0030afe3): Support explicit cross-ecosystem dependency ordering and release propagation.

### Refactors

- [`1932935`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/1932935da7bd936f07c4f3bc58b01e9552350994): Document and enforce dependency-kind ordering and propagation policies.

## v0.1.0-alpha.5

### Bug Fixes

- [`fce12df`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/fce12dff6bf2282af11f9129d3620ef852daf1e8): Plan Rust package and workspace dependency version edits as one deterministic batch.

## v0.1.0-alpha.4

### Bug Fixes

- [`3b961e0`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/3b961e069ea4bd5b43e5b29bf2f5c5fc39414c9b): Return errors instead of panicking when release planning, configuration, changelog, and resolver invariants are unavailable.

### Refactors

- [`f42b195`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/f42b195058a4f6972f1a7468023c0512f4845d24): Keep recoverable input failures as errors while using documented `expect` calls for verified internal invariants.
- [`56e0686`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/56e06863fb2846497ed0b79417d68f3cf17eb8ca): Enforce the production unwrap policy through shared workspace Clippy configuration while allowing documented internal expects.

### New Features

- [`09e7af6`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/09e7af6e76bed7a01b72e6a675504ab308732d2f): Plan Rust and Node changelog updates as validated file edits that can safely create a missing changelog.

## v0.1.0-alpha.3

### Bug Fixes

- [`970de01`](https://github.com/noctisynth/semifold/commit/970de019abd60f6ff889b8520c76b46e51044eba): Define planned file hashes as SHA-256 digests of the source bytes for reliable edit validation.

### New Features
